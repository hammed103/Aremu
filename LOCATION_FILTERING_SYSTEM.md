# Location Filtering System

## Overview
Location now works as a **FILTER** instead of scoring. Jobs that don't match user's `preferred_locations` are excluded entirely from results, ensuring users only see relevant opportunities.

## Key Changes

### ‚ùå **Before: Location Scoring**
- Location was worth 10 points in the matching score
- Jobs in wrong locations still appeared with lower scores
- Users saw irrelevant jobs from distant cities

### ‚úÖ **After: Location Filtering**
- Location works as a binary filter (PASS/FAIL)
- Jobs that don't match are excluded completely
- Only relevant jobs reach the scoring phase
- Total scoring reduced from 172 to 162 points (location removed)

## Intelligent Abbreviation Handling

### üá≥üá¨ **Nigerian Location Intelligence**

#### Major Cities with Abbreviations
```python
nigerian_locations = {
    # Lagos variations
    "lagos": ["lagos", "los", "lagos state", "lagos island", "lagos mainland", 
             "ikeja", "victoria island", "vi", "ikoyi", "lekki", "surulere", "yaba"],
    "los": ["lagos", "los", "lagos state"],
    
    # Abuja variations  
    "abuja": ["abuja", "fct", "federal capital territory", "garki", "wuse", 
             "maitama", "asokoro", "gwarinpa"],
    "fct": ["abuja", "fct", "federal capital territory"],
    
    # Port Harcourt variations
    "port harcourt": ["port harcourt", "ph", "portharcourt", "rivers", "rivers state"],
    "ph": ["port harcourt", "ph", "portharcourt", "rivers"],
    
    # Other major cities
    "kano": ["kano", "kano state"],
    "ibadan": ["ibadan", "oyo", "oyo state"],
    "kaduna": ["kaduna", "kaduna state"],
    # ... more cities
}
```

#### Regional Proximity (Same Region Only)
```python
regional_clusters = {
    "southwest": ["lagos", "ibadan", "abeokuta", "ilorin", "oshogbo", "akure"],
    "southeast": ["enugu", "onitsha", "aba", "owerri", "umuahia", "awka"],
    "southsouth": ["port harcourt", "warri", "benin", "calabar", "uyo"],
    "northcentral": ["abuja", "jos", "makurdi", "minna", "lokoja"],
    "northwest": ["kano", "kaduna", "zaria", "sokoto", "katsina"],
    "northeast": ["maiduguri", "yola", "bauchi", "gombe", "jalingo"],
}
```

### üåç **International Location Support**
```python
country_mappings = {
    "nigeria": ["nigeria", "ng", "nigerian", "naija"],
    "ghana": ["ghana", "gh", "ghanaian"],
    "kenya": ["kenya", "ke", "kenyan", "nairobi"],
    "south africa": ["south africa", "za", "sa", "cape town", "johannesburg"],
    "united states": ["usa", "us", "united states", "america", "american"],
    "united kingdom": ["uk", "united kingdom", "britain", "british", "england", "london"],
    # ... more countries
}
```

## Filtering Logic

### 1. **No Location Preferences**
```python
if not user_locations:
    return True  # Allow all jobs
```

### 2. **Remote Work Bypass**
```python
if "remote" in user_work_arrangements:
    if job_allows_remote_work(job):
        return True  # Remote jobs bypass location filtering
```

### 3. **Willing to Relocate**
```python
if willing_to_relocate and (job_location or ai_city or ai_country):
    return True  # Allow all jobs with valid locations
```

### 4. **Location Matching Hierarchy**
1. **Direct Exact Matches**: `user_location in job_location/ai_city/ai_state`
2. **Nigerian Abbreviations**: Lagos ‚Üî LOS, Abuja ‚Üî FCT, Port Harcourt ‚Üî PH
3. **International Matching**: Country-level equivalents
4. **Regional Proximity**: Same Nigerian region only (strict)

## Database Fields Used

### User Preferences
- `preferred_locations[]` - Array of user's preferred cities/states/countries
- `willing_to_relocate` - Boolean for relocation flexibility
- `work_arrangements[]` - Array including "remote" for remote work preference

### Job Data (Canonical Jobs Table)
- `location` - Original job location text
- `ai_city` - AI-extracted city name
- `ai_state` - AI-extracted state/province
- `ai_country` - AI-extracted country
- `ai_remote_allowed` - Boolean for remote work capability
- `ai_work_arrangement` - AI-extracted work arrangement

## Remote Work Intelligence

### AI-First Approach
```python
def _job_allows_remote_work(job):
    # 1. Check AI fields first (highest priority)
    if ai_remote_allowed is not None or ai_work_arrangement:
        return ai_remote_allowed or "remote" in ai_work_arrangement
    
    # 2. Legacy fields (fallback)
    if is_remote:
        return True
    
    # 3. Text-based detection (last resort)
    return any(keyword in job_text for keyword in remote_keywords)
```

### Remote Keywords
- "remote", "work from home", "wfh", "telecommute", "distributed"

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ **Location Filtering Tests**
```
Lagos job for Lagos user: ‚úÖ PASS (exact match)
Abuja job for Lagos user: ‚ùå FILTERED (different city)
LOS job for Lagos user: ‚úÖ PASS (abbreviation intelligence)
PH job for Lagos user: ‚ùå FILTERED (different city)
Remote job for remote user: ‚úÖ PASS (remote bypass)
On-site Kano job for Lagos user: ‚ùå FILTERED (different city, not remote)
Remote Kano job for remote user: ‚úÖ PASS (remote bypass)
```

## Benefits

### üéØ **For Users**
1. **Relevant Results Only**: No more jobs in wrong cities
2. **Abbreviation Smart**: Understands LOS = Lagos, FCT = Abuja, PH = Port Harcourt
3. **Remote Work Aware**: Remote jobs bypass location restrictions
4. **Regional Intelligence**: Understands Nigerian geography and proximity

### üöÄ **For System Performance**
1. **Faster Processing**: Fewer jobs to score after filtering
2. **Better Relevance**: Higher quality job recommendations
3. **Reduced Noise**: Eliminates irrelevant location matches

### üí° **For Developers**
1. **Clear Logic**: Filter first, score second
2. **Maintainable**: Separate concerns (filtering vs scoring)
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new location mappings
4. **Debuggable**: Clear pass/fail decisions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Distance Calculations**: Real commute times for Nigerian cities
2. **User Location Learning**: Learn from user interactions
3. **Dynamic Abbreviations**: Auto-detect new location abbreviations
4. **Timezone Awareness**: Consider time zones for remote work
5. **Public Transport**: Integration with Lagos BRT, Abuja metro routes

**The location filtering system ensures users only see jobs they can actually work at, making job discovery more efficient and relevant.** üéØ
