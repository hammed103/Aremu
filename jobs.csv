### **Job Description/Requirements**

  

Hi, thank you for choosing to apply for this role.  



  

**About us**

Shaybet Services Limited is an indigenous electro\\-mechanical engineering service company based in Lagos, Nigeria.  



  

For almost a decade, we have partnered with the most ambitious companies advancing industrialisation in Africa. Providing them with our unique electromechanical engineering expertise, throughout: engineering thinking, conception, design, execution, and maintenance of projects that go on to solve, not just their underlying engineering


problem but the overarching business problem.  



  

We are committed to challenging how engineering is practiced domestically by raising the standard of innovation and project delivery with every client we service. This is why we are the preferred engineering service provider for blue chip manufacturing companies and multinationals like FMN, Reckitt, CHI, Unilever and Promasidor.  



  

**About the role**

This position is for the role of Sales \\& Business Development Lead.  



  

We'll be sending over the broader ""Role \\& Responsibility"" details further along the hiring process. For now, there are three main characteristics we are look out for. This should also help you decide if this role is a fit;  



  

* The professional must be a ""go out and get it done"" person, who has the expertise, but most importantly: confidence and wit to navigate the complex power dynamics required to sell a small profitable underdog cum challenger brand, to powerful decision makers.
* It has to be someone experienced enough to recognise that, fundamentally, there is a hierarchy in the ""Brand\\-Marketing\\-Sales value chain"", and is curious and willing to understand how this value chain currently works internally for us—the cohesion involved—then translate our unique strategy into their work.

A business nerd, who loves and lives for what they do and immerses themselves completely in the company, category, customer and product to better contextualise and enrich their sales tactics.  

* 
  

P.S. It goes without saying that this is also a business development role and so the ideal sales man or woman is one who is not just interested in short\\-term conversion but takes pride in relationship building and deploying long term growth initiatives.

**Background:**  

Nigeria is implementing a national Measles\\-Rubella (MR) vaccination campaign targeting a projected 102,539,762 children aged 9 months to 14 years. This will be followed by the introduction of the Measles Rubella vaccine into the routine immunization schedule to be administered at 9 months and 15 months of age. Nigeria has also introduced the Human Papillomavirus vaccine into its routine immunization schedule in 2023\\-24 for girls aged 9 years. However, the uptake is still suboptimal for measles and HPV vaccines in the routine programme. Lessons from past campaigns, including the introduction of the HPV vaccine in 2023/2024, evidenced parental concerns, adolescent disengagement, inadequate school engagement, and poor community acceptance in some states due to lack of knowledge, rumours, and misinformation played a key role in suboptimal performance. Therefore, it is paramount to integrate the HPV vaccine intensification with the upcoming MR introduction campaign as well as there is a need for strong community engagement to address possible barriers, minimize refusals of the MR and HPV vaccines, to improve uptake of measles rubella and HPV vaccines in target states.
  

**How can you make a difference?**  

**Purpose Of Assignment:**  

A Measles Rubella Vaccine Knowledge, Attitude, Behaviour and Practice (KABP) study conducted in June 2025 revealed that despite 69% of the respondents having no information on Rubella disease, 89% of the respondents were willing to avail eligible children to the vaccination posts if the government availed the vaccine at no cost. Additionally, Health workers, religious leaders, Community leaders, and the radio were the most preferred sources of information. There is a need, therefore, to be strategic in the provision of relevant information needed to the communities, using the preferred structures that the communities can relate to. The planned 2025/2026 MR catch\\-up campaign targets to vaccinate over 100 million children aged 9 months to 14 years nationwide, with potent MR vaccines, irrespective of their immunization status, using over 56,000 vaccination teams.
  

**Objective:**  

To increase demand for vaccines for the integrated MR campaign and its subsequent routinization in 36 states and the FCT. Specifically, the assignment will:  

  



* Engage government and private sectors at national, state and LGA levels
* Engage CSOs and CBOs at community levels Intensify schools and community platforms for awareness and engagement to promote the MR and other RI vaccines
* Streamline demand promotion at the State, LGA and ward level
* Utilize existing community structures to reach the underserved populations

Are you tired of software development that crawls at a snail's pace? Do you cringe at inefficient code and outdated methodologies? If you're the kind of engineer who demands excellence and embraces the AI revolution in software development, we want you on our team.
  

While most engineering teams are still stuck in the past—manually debugging, suffering through clunky deployments, and barely scratching the surface of AI capabilities—Trilogy is pioneering a new frontier.

Sitting Through Unnecessary Meetings: Your keyboard will see more action than meeting room chairs—we prioritize productive development over excessive discussion  
* 

**Java Software Engineer Key Responsibilities**  



Create and integrate AI\\-powered features that optimize workflows and provide service providers with cutting\\-edge tools to enhance their capabilities  

* 

**Basic Requirements**  



* Proven track record with 4\\+ years in commercial software development, specifically building production\\-grade server\\-side web applications
* Hands\\-on experience with GenAI code assistants such as Github Copilot, Cursor, or v0\\.dev (Note: We're seeking developers familiar with LLM technologies, not traditional ML engineers)
Enthusiasm for incorporating GenAI tools into your everyday development workflow to maximize efficiency and innovation

### **About Sun King**


Sun King is the world’s leading off\\-grid solar energy company, combining cutting\\-edge product design, fintech, and field operations to deliver energy access for the 1\\.8 billion people who live without an affordable and reliable electric\\-grid connection. Sun King has connected more than 20 million homes to solar power across Africa and Asia, adding over 200,000 homes each month.  

Sun King makes solar products affordable to low\\-income households and businesses via ‘pay\\-as\\-you\\-go’ purchase financing. Sun King installs solar after customers pay a small deposit. Customers then make small, manageable payments of as little as US $0\\.11 a day via mobile money or cash.  

Instead of paying for expensive, polluting, and health\\-damaging kerosene for lighting or diesel for power, customers unlock savings through accessing solar power and after one to two years of payments, customers own their solar equipment outright. To date, our Sun King solar products have saved customers more than $4 billion cumulatively.  

  

Sun King collects payments digitally through mobile money systems and its 28,000 field agents — over 650,000 payments each day. Embedded electronics inside each Sun King device regulate usage based on payments, similar to the operation of a pre\\-paid mobile or electricity meter.  

From cost\\-effective solar systems that provide home lighting and phone charging to robust solar inverters that can power high\\-energy appliances such as laptops, computers, refrigerators, and more, effectively acting as a full stand\\-in for grid power, Sun King’s products cater to a wide range of income segments and energy needs. Leveraging its proven distribution network and brand, Sun King is expanding its range of products and services to encompass clean cooking, electric mobility, entertainment, and more, aiming to address the needs of our underserved customers.
  

Sun King employs 2,800 full\\-time staff in 12 countries, with specialties spanning product design, data science, logistics, customer service, sales, software, operations, and more — all with a passion to serve off\\-grid families.  

Sun King is committed to gender diversity in the workplace. Women represent 44% of Sun King’s workforce.",,https://ng.indeed.com/cmp/Sun-King,,,,,,,,,,,,
