## ðŸ”§ **Implemented Improvements**

### **1. Salary Scoring Enhancement**
**File**: `whatsapp_bot/legacy/intelligent_job_matcher.py` & `ai_parser_service/legacy/intelligent_job_matcher.py`

**Change**: Increased baseline for jobs without salary data
```python
# OLD: return 8.0  # Give 8/20 points for jobs without salary data
# NEW: return 10.0  # Give 10/20 points for jobs without salary data (improved from 8)
```

**Impact**: +2 points for jobs with missing salary information (25% increase)

### **2. Experience Matching - Entry-Level Friendly**
**File**: `whatsapp_bot/legacy/intelligent_job_matcher.py`

**Changes**:
- **Level Compatibility**: More lenient for entry-level users applying to junior/mid roles
- **Years Matching**: Special handling for 0-year users applying to 1-3 year jobs

```python
# Enhanced entry-level scoring
if user_index == 0:  # Entry-level user
    if gap == 1:  # Entry -> Junior (very common)
        return 8.0  # Improved from 2.0
    elif gap == 2:  # Entry -> Mid (still acceptable)
        return 6.0  # Improved from 2.0
    elif gap == 3:  # Entry -> Senior (stretch but possible)
        return 4.0  # New - was 0.0

# Special case for 0 years experience
elif user_years == 0 and ai_years_min <= 3:
    if ai_years_min <= 1:
        return 8.0  # 0 years vs 1 year - very close
    elif ai_years_min <= 2:
        return 6.0  # 0 years vs 2 years - acceptable
    else:  # ai_years_min == 3
        return 4.0  # 0 years vs 3 years - stretch but possible
```

**Impact**: +3-5 points for entry-level users applying to 1-3 year experience jobs

### **3. Industry Scoring - Sales-Friendly**
**File**: `whatsapp_bot/legacy/intelligent_job_matcher.py`

**Changes**:
- **Sales Cross-Industry**: Sales roles now score well across many industries
- **Enhanced Keywords**: Better recognition of sales-friendly industries

```python
# Special handling for sales roles - they work across many industries
sales_keywords = ["sales", "account", "business development", "key account"]
is_sales_user = any(keyword in role.lower() for role in user_roles 
                   for keyword in sales_keywords)

if is_sales_user:
    # Sales roles are valuable across many industries
    sales_friendly_industries = [
        "healthcare", "medical", "pharmaceutical", "finance", "financial",
        "insurance", "retail", "real estate", "consulting", "business",
        "technology", "software", "manufacturing", "automotive"
    ]
    for ai_industry in ai_industries:
        ai_industry_lower = ai_industry.lower()
        if any(industry in ai_industry_lower for industry in sales_friendly_industries):
            return 15.0  # Good match for sales in relevant industries
        elif "sales" in ai_industry_lower:
            return 20.0  # Perfect match for sales industry
```

**Impact**: +2-3 points for sales roles in healthcare, tech, finance, etc.

### **4. Title Matching - Enhanced Sales Variations**
**File**: `whatsapp_bot/legacy/intelligent_job_matcher.py`

**Changes**:
- **Sales Title Variations**: Better matching between Sales Manager, Sales Executive, etc.
- **Fuzzy Matching**: More lenient similarity thresholds for sales roles

```python
# Special handling for sales-related titles
if "sales" in user_role_lower and "sales" in ai_title_lower:
    # Sales Manager vs Sales Executive should score highly
    sales_terms = ["manager", "executive", "supervisor", "representative", 
                  "associate", "specialist", "coordinator", "lead"]
    user_has_sales_term = any(term in user_role_lower for term in sales_terms)
    job_has_sales_term = any(term in ai_title_lower for term in sales_terms)
    
    if user_has_sales_term and job_has_sales_term:
        max_score = max(max_score, 32.0)  # High score for sales variations
    elif "sales" in user_role_lower and "sales" in ai_title_lower:
        max_score = max(max_score, 30.0)  # Good score for any sales match

# More lenient fuzzy matching for sales
elif similarity > 0.6 and "sales" in user_role_lower:
    max_score = max(max_score, 22.0)
```

**Impact**: +2-7 points for sales title variations (Sales Manager vs Sales Executive)
