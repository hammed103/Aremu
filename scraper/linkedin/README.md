## Batch Saving Strategy

**Key Innovation:** Jobs are saved **immediately** after each query:

2. **Save jobs to database** immediately (45-50 jobs or whatever found)
3. **Show progress** and database status
4. **Move to next query** - no waiting for entire strategy

**Benefits:**
- âœ… **No data loss** if scraping is interrupted
- âœ… **Real-time progress** tracking
- âœ… **Continuous database updates**

## Configuration

The scraper covers:
- **6 Nigerian cities** (Nigeria, Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, etc.)
- **10 key search terms** (software engineer, data analyst, etc.)
- **50 jobs per search** with full details
- **5-second delays** between searches

## Database Integration

Jobs are saved to `raw_jobs` table with:
- `source` = 'linkedin'
- `source_job_id` = unique LinkedIn job ID
- `raw_data` = complete job data in JSONB
- `source_url` = direct LinkedIn job URL
- **Immediate saving** after each query
- Automatic duplicate prevention

## Expected Results

**Comprehensive scraping will collect:**
- 1,000-3,000 detailed LinkedIn jobs
- Complete job descriptions and requirements
- Company information and locations
- Direct links to LinkedIn postings
- All saved with **batch saving** - no data loss risk

Perfect for building a comprehensive Nigerian job database! ðŸŽ¯
